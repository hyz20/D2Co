Due to regulations of the Chinese government (as mentioned above), for now, we have to use email to make sure that you are a researcher or practitioner in China. Then you have to sign some files to promise that you will NOT disclose this dataset. Please send us your name, institution (which must lie in China) via this email address: kuairand@gmail.com

We are very sorry for the inconvenience! We will try to overcome this problem soon.
